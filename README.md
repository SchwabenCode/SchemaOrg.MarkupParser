## Give Thanks
It took many hours to create this library in its published form.  
If you like the library and saved you much time, then maybe respect this with a small donation to the [animal shelter of Stuttgart](http://www.tierheim-stuttgart.de/).

If you want to thank me personally, take a look at [my personal Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/gp/registry/wishlist/H6KLKT7UMI7Z/).
